# Recipe-transformation-using-Parsing
This code would scrape a recipe information from allrecipes.com and transform the recipe according to user preferences. 

The files in the data and extra folder are required.

Please install requirements using pip. They are listed in the requirements.txt folder.

Please run this file in powershell(if on windows) and maximised if possible for an optimum viewing experience.

This code uses nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger') which sometimes seems to mess things up as it gives different output on different computers (sometimes).
